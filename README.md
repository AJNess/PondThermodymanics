# PondThermodymanics
Included in this repo is the code manipulated to make the heat map visulaizations during the initial analysis of the ponds researched in the article titled "Shallow waterbodies are not all mixed up: Multiple mixing regimes in ponds and shallow lakes depend on morphology and meteorology" currently under review for publication in Limnology. There was expressed interest in these plots, so I thought this would be the right place to leave the code.

Note: I know those who expressed interest have access to the data (more importantly the data format). The annotations in the code will hopefully help anyone without access to the data navigate through the function. If you want to replicate the plots but are having difficulities with your data, feel free to reach out at andy.ness98@gmail.com and I will hopefully be able to help!
