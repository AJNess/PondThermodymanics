# PondThermodymanics
Included in this repo is the code manipulated to make the heat map visulaizations during the initial analysis of the ponds researched in the article titled "Shallow waterbodies are not all mixed up: Multiple mixing regimes in ponds and shallow lakes depend on morphology and meteorology" currently under review for publication in Limnology. There was expressed interest in these plots, so I thought this would be the right place to leave the code.
